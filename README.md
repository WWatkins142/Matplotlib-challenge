In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

While 249 mice were part of the study only 248 are part of this analysis due to duplicates that could not be verified. All data from this mouse was removed during data cleaning.
